This is my Neovim configuration as of 8-11-23

# Copilot status

I recently added Github copilot since I have access to it because I am a student, so why not.

I will probably end up removing it once I lose access to my student account.

I really don't use the copilot's suggestions, in fact most of the time I have it disabled.

# Auto-Bracket

I don't know if many neovim users have this, I just find this comfortable and faster.

# code formatting

It sucks I can't format code in typescript/javascript using the lsp, I wonder if prettier will help with that.

For now code foramtting has worked for any other type (I only tested rust).
